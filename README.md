Face Detection Model
This repository contains a simple face detection script using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier. The script reads an image, converts it to grayscale, detects faces, and draws bounding boxes around them.

Features-
1) Loads a pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier for frontal face detection.
2) Converts the input image to grayscale for better face detection accuracy.
3) Detects faces in the image and draws bounding boxes around them.
4) Counts and prints the number of detected faces.
5) Displays the image with bounding boxes for a short duration.
